"Jessie","Hey, Cloud. You want to look at this with me?It's a map of the Midgar Rail System. Let's look at it together. I'll explain it to you.I like this kinda stuff. Bombs and monitors... you know, flashy stuff.Okay, it's about to start.This is a complete model of the city of Midgar.It's about a 1/10000 scale.The top plate is about 50 meters above ground.A main support structure holds the plate up in the center, and there are other support structures built in each section...psst... whisper... whisper (The No. 1 Reactor we blew up was in the northern section.)Then there's No. 2, No. 3 all the way up to the No. 8 Reactor.The 8 Reactors provide Midgar with electricity.Each town used to have a name, but no one in Midgar remembers them.Instead of names, we refer to them by numbered sectors. That's the kind of place this is.Phew..., this is next! Look.This is the route this train is on.The route spirals around the main support structure.We should be coming around the center area, right now.At each checkpoint, an ID sensor device is set up.It can check the identities and backgrounds on each and every passenger on the train by linking it up to the central data bank at Shinra headquarters.whisper... whisper... (Anyone could tell that we look suspicious, so we're using fake ID's.)","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/01.html","Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor",1
"Jessie","Speak of the devil...That light means that we're in the ID Security Check area....whisper... whisper... (When the lights go off, you never know what kind of creeps'll come out.)...anyhow, we're almost back now. That's a relief.","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/01.html","Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor",1
"Wedge","I'm seein' stars. This sucks. I hate the dark.","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/01.html","Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor",1

"Barret","Huh?Never expect ta hear that outta someone like you....you jes' full of surprises.The upper world... a city on a plate...It's 'cuz of that &amp;^#$# 'pizza', that people underneath are sufferin'!And the city below is full of polluted air.On topa that, the Reactor keeps drainin' up all the energy.","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/01.html","Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor",1
"Cloud","Then why doesn't everyone move onto the Plate?","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/01.html","Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor",1

"Station Man","When you've been a train man as long as I have, you see a lot of people and a lot of lives.People meeting, parting, joy, sadness... After a while, it doesn't even get to you anymore.I wonder how long it's been... There's an invisible rail between me and the passengers.I could never live their lives. I'm just a train man plain and simple. It's easier that way.That's not to say that the crossing gate of my heart doesn't hurt now and again.Back during the war, I remember there was a lot of painful scenes then.But, that's a story for another day...First train leaves Midgar at 05:04am.","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/02.html","Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven",2

"Ester","I'll be your manager.","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/17.html","Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne",17
"Mr. Coates","Well, I have nothing against it, but...This is Ester. She may look kinda funny...But there's no better manager in the races...","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/17.html","Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne",17
"Ester","That's so rude...Yeah, well. Nice to meet you, Cloud.","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/17.html","Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne",17
"Mr. Coates","All right then, Cloud.I'll send you up the elevator. Ester'll fill you in on the details.","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/17.html","Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne",17
"Ester","Hmm, so that's what happened. I'll talk to Dio directly. You just concentrate on the race.Oh yeah, getting back to the other thing, there are many different types of Chocobo jockeys. It's not only for criminals.Some people compete for the fame, some people compete for the money, some for glory... And then there're people like you.Oh yeah, I'll teach you how to ride a Chocobo.","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/17.html","Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne",17
"Cloud","- All right- Not interested","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/17.html","Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne",17
"Ester","Ummm... First use the [Select] button to choose either AUTO or MANUAL.In other words, either you control the Chocobo or let it run on its own.But it's pretty hard to make the Chocobo run the way you want it to. If the Chocobo doesn't like you, it won't listen.You can't really help on this one.But, most of the Chocobo's that I'll provide you with are mellow and you should be able to handle them.When you're riding, use the [] Button to Speed Up and the X Button to Slow Down.But, if you go faster than the Chocobo can handle, it'll lose its stamina really fast.And use the Directional button to move the Chocobo left and right, use the O Button to get a boost of speed.Of course your stamina runs out faster though.There are some bad tempered Chocobos that can't pace themselves and they'll lose their stamina pretty fast.For these kinds of Chocobos, you should set the controls on Manual and slow it down.Finally, some advice for the restless, once the first and second Chocobo cross the goal line,Push the [Start] button to end the race.","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/17.html","Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne",17

What about their consciousness, their hearts and their souls?The soul too returns to the Planet.And not only those of humans, but everything on this Planet. In fact, all living things in the universe, are the same.The spirits that return to the Planet, merge with one another and roam the Planet.They roam, converge, and divide, becoming a swell, called the 'Lifestream'.Lifestream... In other words, a path of energy of the souls roaming the Planet.'Spirit Energy' is a word that you should never forget.A new life... children are blessed with Spirit energy and are brought into the world.Then, the time comes when they die and once again return to the Planet...Of course there are exceptions, but this is the way of the world.I've digressed, but you'll understand better if you watch this.","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/19.html","Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki",19

"Cloud","This huge Temple? This is the Black Materia!?Then no one could take it.","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/25.html","Temple of the Ancients",25
"Aeris","Hmm, it's pretty hard.

That's what is meant by Jenova's Reunion.I have been waiting for the Reunion to start. Five years have passed, and now the Clones have begun to return.I thought the clones would begin to gather at Midgar where Jenova is stored.But my predictions were not entirely correct. Jenova itself began to move away from the Shinra Building.But being a genius that I am, I soon figured it out. You see it was all Sephiroth's doing.Sephiroth is not just content to diffuse his will into the Lifestream; he wants to manipulate the Clones himself.","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/30.html","Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land",30

"Tifa","Five Years ago... I saw the real Sephiroth for the very first time.","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/36.html","Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind",36
"Tifa","So this is... the Great Sephiroth.","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/36.html","Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind",36

"Tifa","Cloud, what about your other memories?No, not memories.A memory is something that has to be consciously recalled, right?That's why sometimes it can be mistaken and a different thing......But it's different from a memory locked deep within your heart......That's why it must be a fake. If he could recall up that memory......That's it! What about some memory that has to do with me?I say something and you don't remember it......But you say something, and I remember it, too... Then we'll know that's our memory......Talk to me. About anything, some important memory to you...Now that you mention it, why did you want to join SOLDIER in the first place?I always thought it was a sudden decision you made......","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/36.html","Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind",36

"Tifa","But we were children, back then.","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/36.html","Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind",36
"Young Cloud","...I know. I'm the one that was stupid.I really wanted to play with everyone, but I was never allowed into the group.Then later... I began to think I was different...That I was different from those immature kids.That then... maybe...","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/36.html","Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind",36
"Young Cloud","I was so prejudiced. And... weak.","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/36.html","Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind",36
"Tifa","Yeah... it was so sudden. I was... a bit surprised.But...It's true that we weren't THAT close, but...After you left town, I really thought about you a lot.I used to wonder how Cloud was doing.I wonder if Cloud was able to get into SOLDIER?I started reading the newspapers, thinking that there might be an article about you.","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/36.html","Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind",36

"Cloud","Tifa was in a coma for seven days.We all thought she wouldn't make it.If only I could've saved her...I was so angry...

"Cloud","I never was in SOLDIER.I made up the stories about what happened to me five years ago, about being in SOLDIER.I left my village looking for glory, but never made it in to SOLDIER......I was so ashamed of being so weak; then I heard this story from my friend Zack...And I created an illusion of myself made up of what I had seen in my life......And I continued to play the charade as if it were true.","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/36.html","Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind",36

"Cloud","I'm physically built like someone in SOLDIER.Hojo's plan to clone Sephiroth wasn't that difficult.It was just the same procedure they use when creating members of SOLDIER.You see, someone in SOLDIER isn't simply exposed to Mako energy.Their bodies are actually injected with Jenova cells......For better or worse, only the strong can enter SOLDIER.It has nothing to do with the Jenova Reunion.But weak people...... like me, get lost in the whole thing.The combination of Jenova cells, Sephiroth's strong will, and my own weakness are what created me.Everyone knew that. I'm...... Cloud.......the master of my own illusionary world.But I can't remain trapped in an illusion any more......I'm going to live my life without pretending.","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/36.html","Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind",36

"Yuffie","Oh......Isn't there any way to prevent this?","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/36.html","Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind",36
"Cloud","Well, according to my research......First off, if you're nervous a lot, you won't get sick.But you can't always be nervous.With this much space, your best bet is to move around while you're riding.It also might be a good idea to stretch sometimes, too.But in SOLDIER, we spent a lot of time in trucks.That sucked!......And there's one thing you mustn't do when riding.And that is......Read!Once you get sick, there's nothing anyone can do.I know it's tough......","https://www.yinza.com/Fandom/Script/36.html","Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind",36
